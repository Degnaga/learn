      Summer is a time for adventure, and this year was no exception. I had many
      exciting experiences, but two of my favorites were my trip to the beach
      and my week at summer camp.

      At the beach, I spent my days swimming, collecting shells, and building
      sandcastles. I also went on a boat ride and saw dolphins swimming
      alongside us.
